    <p>This is just a quick post on the new site.</p>
    <p>I changed to this site from <a href="https://marscapone.github.io" target="_blank">my old GitHub pages one</a>.
      And I just wanted to have at least one post there (here) so it didn't look too empty.</p>
    <p>I have been working on this site, pretty much constantly for the last 3 weeks. It is my first foray into Vue.js,
      and I think it has gone pretty well.</p>
    <p>You will have probably noticed that none of the project pages have a body. This is because I was too eager to
      deploy, and just wanted the website up in a (vaguely) presentable manner. When I have worked out a better way to
      deploy the site - it's static and has to be built every time (AFAIK), I will do so. This will make it much
      easier to add new projects and blog posts.</p>
